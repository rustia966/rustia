        I was born in Bambang, Pasig City. I am the youngest child of Rosanna Sabino and Santiago Sabino. I have an
         older brother named Jose Rusan Sabino. I completed my elementary and secondary education in Pis-anan, Sibalom,
         Antique. And I completed my senior year of high school at the Wright Technological College of Antique. I am
         currently a student of University of Antique taking Bachelor of Information Technology. My hobbies are talking to
         my friends, watching horror and K-drama movies, and listening to music.
