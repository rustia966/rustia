    <p class="para"> I was born in Bambang, Pasig City. I am the youngest child of Rosanna Sabino and Santiago Sabino. I
        have an
        older brother named Jose Rusan Sabino. I completed my elementary and secondary education in Pis-anan, Sibalom,
        Antique. And I completed my senior year of high school at the Wright Technological College of Antique. I am
        currently student of University of Antique taking Bachelor of Information Technology. My hobbies are talking to
        my friends, watching horror and K-drama movies, and listening to music.
